            <p>A 1991 graduate of Gordon College in Massachusetts, Mr. Hanley had a career in programming before becoming a teacher. He has taught at Shenendehowa for an unknown number of years, and besides what you just read, not much is known about the man. He can be seen in room 137 "teaching" the java programming language, or wandering around the tech wing with a coffee in hand. He is known to use words such as "automagically," "right clink," and "boofered," and will probably not like you if you have not seen or do not like The Matrix movies or Ferris Bueller's Day Off.</p>
